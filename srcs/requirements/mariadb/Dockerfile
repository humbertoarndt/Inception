# Run MySQL daemon with address binding to 0.0.0.0*
CMD ["mysqld", "--bind-address=0.0.0.0"]

# *The --bind-address option specifies the IP address to which the server should bind to. 
# Setting it to 0.0.0.0 means that the server will listen on all available network interfaces, 
# which is useful for exposing the MySQL server to other containers.
